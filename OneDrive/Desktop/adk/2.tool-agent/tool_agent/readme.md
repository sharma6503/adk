Tool Types in ADK
ADK offers flexibility by supporting several types of tools:

Function Tools: Tools created by you, tailored to your specific application's needs.
Functions/Methods: Define standard synchronous functions or methods in your code (e.g., Python def).
Agents-as-Tools: Use another, potentially specialized, agent as a tool for a parent agent.
Long Running Function Tools: Support for tools that perform asynchronous operations or take significant time to complete.
Built-in Tools: Ready-to-use tools provided by the framework for common tasks. Examples: Google Search, Code Execution, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
Third-Party Tools: Integrate tools seamlessly from popular external libraries. Examples: LangChain Tools, CrewAI Tools.
